# How to make programmers scream
By Cole Gannon & Marcus Luebke & Joshua Bennett.
### About this guide
In this book, I'm going to teach you how to Obfuscate your **JAVASCRIPT** code **[MANUALLY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manual).** If you're not looking to spend time manually obfuscating your code, then don't bother reading anymore of this book past this page. Just take a look at the links I reference below.
### Intro: Obfuscation, an explanation
Obfuscation is a programming technique in which code is intentionally obscured to prevent reverse engineering and deliver unclear code to anyone other than the programmer. I couldn't have said it better myself. Thanks [techopedia](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/16375/obfuscation).

Something I'd like to make painfully clear is that encryption and obfuscation are very different things. Encryption makes data impossible to decode without a key. Obfuscation is the process of making a piece of code redable to the machine but inconvinent and difficult for a human to read. That being said, encryption can be used in obfuscation but you're going to have to include the key in the code. If you don't want to put in the time to manually obfuscate your code or simply don't really want to do it yourself, here's a list of links that'll do it for you.

- [JSFUCK](http://www.jsfuck.com/)
- [jjencode](http://utf-8.jp/public/jjencode.html)
- [aaencode](http://utf-8.jp/public/aaencode.html)
- [Closure Compiler](https://closure-compiler.appspot.com/home)
- [Javascript Obfuscator](https://javascriptobfuscator.com/)
  The reason I don't recommend this Javascript Obfuscator is because it's pretty easy to deobfuscate, see [here](jsdf.md).
- [Dan's Tools](http://www.danstools.com/javascript-obfuscate/index.php)

The Closure Compiler is not only good for obfuscating but can optimise load times too.

Dan's tools make it a pain to read for sure. However, there's nothing that a good few hours of grunt work couldn't do to some javascript code that's obfuscated like this. It'd be boring though. With that, let's move the [Chapter 1](ch1.md)
